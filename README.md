# d3.js Treemap Diagram

#### Description: Treemap diagram created with d3.js. Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I created a Treemap diagram using d3.js that displays the top 100 highest selling video games grouped by platform. I designed it so that when you hover over a video game's square, it shows the name of the game and its revenue. I also created a legend that color codes all of the different gaming platforms.
